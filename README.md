## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Syntax]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Isabella Ebenezer] - [College of Engineering Perumon]
- Member 2: [Arjun M S] - [College of Engineering Perumon]

### Project Description
[This is a single-page web application that uses a user's webcam to take a photo. Based on the captured image, it displays a randomly selected movie scene, offering a fun and playful prediction of the user's "fate."]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[No problem]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[‡¥®‡¥ø‡¥®‡µç‡¥±‡µÜ ‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥ß‡¥ø ‡¥®‡µÄ ‡¥á‡¥™‡µç‡¥™‡µä ‡¥Ö‡¥±‡¥ø‡¥Ø‡µÅ‡¥Ç... (You will know your fate now...)]

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- [HTML, CSS, JavaScript]
- [Tailwind CSS]
- [Google Fonts, Web browser's navigator.mediaDevices API for webcam access, and the <canvas> element for image capture.]
- [Tools used]

For Hardware:
- [List main components]
- [List specifications]
- [List tools required]

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
[There are no installation steps. This is a client-side web application.]

# Run
[commands]

### Project Documentation
For Software:

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)
![ScreenShot1](ss1.png)
*This shows the initial home page where the user can see their live webcam feed and the button to take a photo.*

![Screenshot2](ss2.png)
*This is the results page, displaying the captured image and the "‡¥µ‡¥ø‡¥ß‡¥ø..." (Fate) in the form of a random movie scene*

![Screenshot3](Add screenshot 3 here with proper name)
*Add caption explaining what this shows*

# Diagrams
![Workflow](Add your workflow/architecture diagram here)
The app's workflow is a simple two-page flow. The home page displays the webcam. When the user takes a photo, the app transitions to a second page that displays the captured image and a random video from a predefined list. The user can then click to return to the home page to start over.

For Hardware:

# Schematic & Circuit
![Circuit](Add your circuit diagram here)
*Add caption explaining connections*

![Schematic](Add your schematic diagram here)
*Add caption explaining the schematic*

# Build Photos
![Components](Add photo of your components here)
*List out all components shown*

![Build](Add photos of build process here)
*Explain the build steps*

![Final](Add photo of final product here)
*Explain the final build*

### Project Demo
# Video
[Add your demo video link here]
*Explain what the video demonstrates*

# Additional Demos
[Add any extra demo materials/links]

## Team Contributions
